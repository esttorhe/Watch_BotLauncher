> Use Xcode Server's API with native Swift objects.

First brought to you in [Buildasaur](https://github.com/czechboy0/Buildasaur), now in an independent project.
This is an unofficial, community-maintained project and is not associated with Apple.

# Sources
The easiest way to integrate `XcodeServerSDK` into your project is with Cocoapods. Add this to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

```
pod 'XcodeServerSDK', '0.0.4'
```

# Usage

Create the server config object with the server's URL, username and password.
```swift
let config = XcodeServerConfig(host: "https://127.0.0.1", user: "IRuleBots", password: "superSecr3t")
let server = XcodeServerFactory.server(config)
```

Go wild!
```swift
server.getBots { (bots, error) -> () in
    if let error = error {
        Log.error("Oh no! \(error.description)")
        return
    }
    
    // go crazy with bots
    if let firstBot = bots?.first {
        // use the first bot...
    }
}
```

# Xcode Server Versions
The latest version supporting the old, undocumented Xcode 6 version of the Xcode Server API is [0.0.4](https://github.com/czechboy0/XcodeServerSDK/tree/0.0.4). All newer versions *only* support the new, first publicly documented Xcode 7 version of the API. **Xcode 7 API support is still work in progress.**

# Swift Versions
The latest Swift 1.2 compatible version is [0.0.4](https://github.com/czechboy0/XcodeServerSDK/tree/0.0.4), so put this exact version in your Podfile if you're targetting Swift 1.2. All newer releases will be targetting Swift 2, because we're all just so forward-thinking.

When it comes to branches, [`master`](https://github.com/czechboy0/XcodeServerSDK/tree/master) will still host the latest stable Xcode's version (Xcode 6.3.2 with Swift 1.2), until this fall when Swift 2 will come out of beta with Xcode 7. Until then, please send pull requests and contribute to the [`swift-2`](https://github.com/czechboy0/XcodeServerSDK/tree/swift-2) branch.

# Play with Playground

We're providing a Plaground in which you can easily interact with `XcodeServerSDK` and test it's functionalities without any need to create a new app. Playground target is set to be OS X (so don't use `UIKit` inside).

# Features

- createBot
- getBot
- deleteBot
- getBots
- getIntegrations
- postIntegration
- cancelIntegration
- getDevices
- getUserCanCreateBots

# Projects using XcodeServerSDK
- [Buildasaur](https://github.com/czechboy0/Buildasaur) - connect Xcode Server with GitHub Pull Requests.
- (using XcodeServerSDK too? Send a PR with a link to your project added here!)

Want to create yours but need some inspiration? Watch [this WWDC 2015 session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=410) on Xcode Server!
Using hardware buttons to start integrations? Why not! The sky is the limit.
